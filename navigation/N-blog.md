# Sprint Reflections

## Sprint 1: Tools and Software Development Processes

### Overview
The first sprint was all about building a solid foundation in essential tools and processes for software development. From setting up GitHub Pages to coding in Jupyter Notebooks, and working with Markdown, HTML, and JavaScript, each step helped me gain confidence in organizing, documenting, and sharing my work. These early skills, especially in version control and documentation, will be critical as I move into more complex coding challenges.

#### Key Takeaways
- **Version Control with GitHub**: Learning GitHub has given me a clear method for managing code changes, which is helping me keep my projects organized.
- **Markdown Documentation**: Practicing with Markdown helped me create clear, structured documentation—a skill I realize is just as important as the code itself.
- **Intro to Coding Languages**: By working with HTML, JavaScript, and Markdown, I was able to see how each language plays a different role in software development and understand their unique structures and uses.

#### Next Steps
In the future, I aim to:
- Streamline my use of **version control** by committing code more strategically, capturing meaningful changes in each update.
- Continue developing my **documentation skills**, focusing on clarity and organization to make my work easier for others to follow and for myself to revisit.

> **Reflection**: Mastering GitHub and Markdown was challenging, but they are already proving invaluable in organizing my projects. I feel that this early investment in these tools will continue to pay off in the sprints to come.

## Sprint 2: JavaScript Fundamentals and Game Development

### Overview
Sprint 2 shifted to JavaScript fundamentals, especially object-oriented programming (OOP) with a focus on game development. Diving into OOP was my first real introduction to concepts like classes, methods, and data handling. This sprint also emphasized control structures and other JavaScript basics through projects that made these concepts concrete and engaging.

#### Key Takeaways
- **Control Structures**: Practicing with loops, conditional statements, and functions helped me understand how to control the flow of a program—a skill I’m seeing is crucial in all coding projects.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Learning to use classes and methods provided insight into how code can be organized and reused, although this approach was initially challenging.
- **Game Development Elements**: Exploring basic game mechanics through JavaScript was not only enjoyable but also showed me how fundamental coding concepts come together in a project.

#### Next Steps
Moving forward, I plan to:
- Strengthen my grasp of **OOP concepts** by further experimenting with classes and objects to deepen my understanding of structuring code.
- Focus on building **debugging skills** to better understand and resolve issues that arise, especially in longer and more intricate code.

> **Reflection**: Though the leap into OOP was challenging, I’m starting to see how thinking in terms of objects and methods can simplify complex projects. The hands-on practice with JavaScript basics and game mechanics made these concepts more approachable and concrete.

## Sprint 3: Blogging and N@tM Presentation Preparation

### Overview
Sprint 3 combined technical and communication skills by requiring me to set up a personal blog on GitHub Pages and prepare for the Night at the Museum (N@tM) presentation. This blog served as a space to document my learning journey and showcase my projects. Preparing for N@tM also meant thinking critically about how to present my work to an audience and gather feedback, both of which were valuable experiences.

#### Key Takeaways
- **Personal Blog on GitHub Pages**: Setting up a blog gave me a structured way to document my progress and share my work. The process also highlighted the importance of maintaining a well-organized portfolio of my projects.
- **Presentation Skills**: Preparing for N@tM involved distilling my projects and learning experiences into a clear and engaging format. This exercise forced me to think about my work from the audience’s perspective, which added depth to my understanding.
- **Audience Feedback**: Receiving feedback from peers, teachers, and other viewers at N@tM helped me identify areas of improvement and new ideas for future projects.

#### Next Steps
For future presentations and documentation efforts, I intend to:
- Refine my **portfolio organization** to ensure that my blog clearly showcases my development and highlights key learning points.
- Focus on **engaging presentation skills** by practicing how to explain my work in ways that are accessible to different audiences, which will be essential for future collaborative projects and reviews.

> **Reflection**: Creating a personal blog and preparing for N@tM were both valuable experiences that taught me how to communicate my work and reflect on my progress. The feedback I received was insightful and provided concrete ways to improve as I move forward in this course.
