    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Monster</td>
        <td>One possible idea that could be implemented into the game is a monster that chases the main character around.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Walls/Map</td>
        <td>In addition to the monster chasing the sprite around, there could be walls so that the game isn't too easy.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Score and Timer</td>
        <td>To make the game more engaging a score could be added to the top of the page. This would foster an environment in which indiviuals would compare scores. The way the scores would work would be based on how many enemies were defeated</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> Weapons </td>
        <td> As to make the game more interesting, I want to add weapons in which the monsters can be defeated, such as a sword or a gun. The weapons could appear automatically when the game reaches a certain score, which avaoids boredom </td>
    </tr> 
    <tr>
        <td> Power ups</td>
        <td> There should be some powerups that appear randomly across the screen at random times, which allow the character to move faster, attack faster, and more.</td>
    <tr>
        <td> Levels with different backgrounds. </td>
        <td> I wanted to include different levels, such as an introductory level which teaches the player how to play the game, and different levels with different enemy sprites. The level's purpose would be to survive for a amount of time, which wouldn't impact the score in any way, as the score's purpose is different
    </tr>
        <td>Sound effects</td>
        <td>I already have background music, but after I add the monster, I want to have sound effects for when a powerup is claimed, when the monster catches you, when the background changes, and when the game ends.</td>
    </tr>
