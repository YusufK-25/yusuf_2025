    <tr>
        <td>Monster</td>
        <td>One possible idea that could be implemented into the game is a monster that chases the main character around.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Walls/Map</td>
        <td>In addition to the monster chasing the sprite around, there could be walls so that the game isn't too easy.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Score and Timer</td>
        <td>To make the game more engaging, a score could be added to the top of the page. This would foster an environment in which individuals would compare scores. The way the scores would work would be based on how many enemies were defeated.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Weapons</td>
        <td>To make the game more interesting, I want to add weapons with which the monsters can be defeated, such as a sword or a gun. The weapons could appear automatically when the game reaches a certain score, which avoids boredom.</td>
    </tr> 
    <tr>
        <td>Power ups</td>
        <td>There should be some power-ups that appear randomly across the screen at random times, which allow the character to move faster, attack faster, and more.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Levels with different backgrounds</td>
        <td>I initally wanted to include different levels, such as an introductory level which teaches the player how to play the game, and different levels with different enemy sprites. The level's purpose would be to survive for an amount of time, which wouldn't impact the score in any way, as the score's purpose is different. However, after watching some presentations, I realised that this wouldn't be sustainable, and decided to change the idea to instead have a random sprite and random background every time the game loaded.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Sound effects</td>
        <td>I already have background music, but after I add the monster, I want to have sound effects for when a power-up is claimed, when the monster catches you, when the background changes, and when the game ends.</td>
    </tr>
