    "  <br><strong>Option 1:</strong> Create a simple combat system. \n",
    "  - Allow characters to fight enemies. \n",
    "  - Use basic functions and conditionals in JavaScript. \n",
    "  - Focus on making it easy to understand how battles work.\n",
    "\n",
    "  <br><br>\n",
    "  <strong>Option 2:</strong> Make a dialogue system for your NPC (Non-Player Character). \n",
    "  - Use the <code style=\"color: #7FFFD4;\">prompt()</code> function to ask the player for a response (choose a number from 1 to 4).\n",
    "  - This dialogue should appear when the player gets close to the NPC and presses a button. \n",
    "</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Tips:\n",
    "- **For Option 1:**\n",
    "  - Start by writing down what the characters and enemies will be. Create simple names and attributes (like health).\n",
    "  - Use `console.log()` to print out what’s happening at each step. This will help you understand the flow of your code.\n",
    "  - Look for example code online to see how others have created combat systems. Don’t be afraid to borrow ideas!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For Option 2:**\n",
    "  - Plan out the dialogue options before you start coding. Write them down in a list.\n",
    "  - Use comments in your code to remind yourself what each part does. For example, `// Ask the player for a response`.\n",
    "  - Test your code frequently. After writing a few lines, run it to see if it works before adding more.\n"
