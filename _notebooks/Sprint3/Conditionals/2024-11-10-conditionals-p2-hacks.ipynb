    "  - Look for example code online to see how others have created combat systems. Don’t be afraid to borrow ideas!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For Option 2:**\n",
    "  - Plan out the dialogue options before you start coding. Write them down in a list.\n",
    "  - Use comments in your code to remind yourself what each part does. For example, `// Ask the player for a response`.\n",
    "  - Test your code frequently. After writing a few lines, run it to see if it works before adding more.\n"
